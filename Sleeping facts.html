    <div style= "scroll-padding-bottom:150px;"> Rest is what sleep is. It comprises of two distinct sleep stages, REM and Non-REM sleep, 
    which alternate in cycles and correspond to two different degrees of brain nerve cell activity.
     NREM (or non-REM) sleep is also known as peaceful sleep.</div>

                including non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

              <td>Practicing good sleep hygiene can help improve the quality of your sleep. 
                This includes establishing a regular sleep schedule, 
                creating a relaxing bedtime routine, 
                ensuring a comfortable sleep environment, 
                and avoiding stimulants like caffeine and electronic devices before bed.</td>
                <td> During REM sleep, when most dreaming occurs, 
                    the brain is highly active, and the eyes move rapidly.
                     Dreams can be vivid and emotionally charged experiences that often reflect our thoughts, emotions, and memories.</td>
                  <td>Sleep plays a vital role in memory consolidation. 
                    During sleep, the brain processes and organizes information,
                     transferring it from short-term memory to long-term memory.
                      Sufficient sleep can enhance learning, memory retention, and problem-solving abilities.</td>
