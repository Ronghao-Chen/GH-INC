        GH INC is a sleeping coach with the aim of helping people experiencing problems with their sleep. Sleep is a very important aspect of our life. We sleep to rest, recover and become mentally fit. People nowaday think of sleep as non-functional thing but sleep is found to be the best source of rest for anyone.The website consists of 4 pages: the Webpage,Facts, Method and the page you are currently on About us.The inspiration of our design came from the experience of really going out there exploring and learning about the benefits of sleep through past developed websites and experts. We wanted to stick to a simple and eye-catching design, we gathered high quality images related to our topic(which is sleeping) and decided to format and place the images where it can be visible and attractive towards the viewers. As mentioned in the first few sentences our target audience are people that experience problems with their sleep. We state the benefits of sleep towards these people and then we suggest detailed methods to improve their overall sleep. The way we created the website was we made an icebreaker page in canva relating to the theme, our developers both suggested ideas regarding sleep. After the icebreaker we created an empathy map that highlighted what our webpage was going to look like, our facts and method page and about us page. After we finished the empathy map we searched up and looked for images relating to sleep and saved it to our documents, after that we started creating the code by using html and css to create and format the website. We created the webpage together both contributing some brilliant ideas. Meanwhile, each person had a task appointed by creating one page and then gathering the code and creating the overall website. In conclusion GH INC worked really hard in order to create the website and hope you enjoy the way everything is created.
